This project is extension of original project of [nextjs-tutorial](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/nextjs-tutorial) developed by [Shaun](https://github.com/iamshaunjp).  I have used [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) instead of JavaScript and normal CSS respectively.

  

## Getting Started

  

First, run the development server:

  

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

  

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

  

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
